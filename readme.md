</div>

Includes many configuration options such as Aikar's flags, automatic restarting, and Pterodactyl overhead calculation.

Inspired by [startmc.sh](https://startmc.sh), built with [Blitz.js](https://blitzjs.com) and [Mantine UI](https://mantine.dev).

### ðŸ”§ Setup
Ensure [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com) and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) are installed.

1. Enter the directory containing the flags.sh source code in your terminal.
2. Install the build dependencies via `yarn install`.

### ðŸ”¨ Running
First, run through the [setup](-setup) steps.

- To start a live development build, run `yarn run start:dev`.
  - This will start a server that updates code changes automatically.
  - This does not generate optimized assets, do not expose this to the public!
- To start a production build, run `yarn run start:prod`.
  - This generates optimized assets.
